Overview
========
This document explains the freertos_sem example, what to expect when running it and a brief
introduction to the API. The freertos_sem example code shows how semaphores works. Two different
tasks are synchronized in bilateral rendezvous model.

The example uses four tasks. One producer_task and three consumer_tasks. The producer_task starts by
creating of two semaphores (xSemaphore_producer and xSemaphore_consumer). These semaphores control
access to virtual item. The synchronization is based on bilateral rendezvous pattern. Both of
consumer and producer must be prepared to enable transaction.




Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.6
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- OM15076-3 Carrier Board
- JN518x Module plugged on the Carrier Board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the USB port (J15) on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
After the board is flashed the Tera Term will show debug console output.

Example output:
