Overview
========
The Hello World project is a simple demonstration program that uses the SDK UART driver in
combination with FreeRTOS. The purpose of this demo is to show how to use the debug console and to
provide a simple project for debugging and further development.

The example application creates one task called hello_task. This task print "Hello world." message
via debug console utility and suspend itself.
