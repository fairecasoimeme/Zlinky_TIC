Overview
========
The USART example for FreeRTOS demonstrates the possibility to use the USART driver in the RTOS.
The example uses single instance of USART IP and writes string into, then reads back chars.
After every 4B received, these are sent back on USART.

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.6

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- OM15076-3 Carrier Board
- JN518x Module plugged on the Carrier Board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the USB port (J15) on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
The following lines are printed to the serial terminal when the demo program is executed.

When you input four characters, system will echo it by UART and them would be seen on the terminal.
