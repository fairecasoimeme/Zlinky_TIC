Overview
========

The lpc_adc_burst example shows how to use LPC ADC driver with the burst mode.

In this example, the sensor is used to created the input analog signal.
When user type in any key from the keyboard, the burst mode is enabled. Then the conversion 
sequence A would be started automatically, till the burst would be disabled in conversion completed ISR. 

Project Information
1.what are ADC conversion sequences?
  A conversion sequence is a single pass through a series of A/D conversions performed on a selected set of
  A/D channels. Software can set-up two independent conversion sequences, either of which can be triggered 
  by software or by a transition on one of the hardware triggers. Each sequence can be triggered by a different 
  hardware trigger. One of these conversion sequences is referred to as the A sequence and the other as the B
  sequence. It is not necessary to employ both sequences. An optional single-step mode allows advancing through
  the channels of a sequence one at a time on each successive occurrence of a trigger. The user can select whether
  a trigger on the B sequence can interrupt an already-in-progress A sequence. The B sequence, however, can never be
  interrupted by an A trigger.
  
2. How to use software-triggered conversion?
   There are two ways that software can trigger a conversion sequence:
      1. Start Bit: The first way to software-trigger an sequence is by setting the START bit in
         the corresponding SEQn_CTRL register. The response to this is identical to
         occurrence of a hardware trigger on that sequence. Specifically, one cycle of
         conversions through that conversion sequence will be immediately triggered except
         as indicated above. 
      2. Burst Mode: The other way to initiate conversions is to set the BURST bit in the
         SEQn_CTRL register. As long as this bit is 1 the designated conversion sequence will
         be continuously and repetitively cycled through. Any new software or hardware trigger
         on this sequence will be ignored. (In this example, we use this way.)
         
3. What kinds of interrupt do ADC have?
   There are four interrupts that can be generated by the ADC:
     • Conversion-Complete or Sequence-Complete interrupts for sequences A and B
     • Threshold-Compare Out-of-Range Interrupt
     • Data Overrun Interrupt
   Any of these interrupt requests may be individually enabled or disabled in the INTEN register.
  
Program Flow
1.This example demonstrates how to configure the A sequences with burst mode, you can configure channel via 
  "DEMO_ADC_SAMPLE_CHANNEL_NUMBER".
  
2.Before configuration of the ADC begins, the ADC is put through a self-calibration cycle.  

3.Enable the Conversion-Complete or Sequence-Complete interrupt for sequences A.
  
4.After ADC channels are assigned to each of the sequences, if the user enters any key via terminal, burst mode will start.  
  
5.When the first conversion completes, the interrupt would be triggered. The ISR will stop the burst mode and print conversion result 
  to terminal.
